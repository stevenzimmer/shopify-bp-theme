It serves to protect the patch and keep it in place.</li><li><strong>Adhesive Layer</strong>: This layer adheres the patch to the skin. It helps maintain contact between the patch and the skin surface, allowing for the gradual release of vitamins.</li><li><strong>Vitamin Formulation</strong>: The active ingredients, which are the vitamins or other nutrients, are contained in this layer. They are often encapsulated or formulated to be released slowly over time.</li><li><strong>Liner or Cover</strong>: This is a protective layer that is removed before applying the patch to the skin.</li></ul><p>The patches are typically applied to clean, dry skin, and they are designed to be worn for a certain period, often ranging from several hours to a day.
